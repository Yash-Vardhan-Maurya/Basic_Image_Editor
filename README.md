Libraries Used: 
1. Tkinter: We need most of the functionality of Tkinter and thus import everything and specifically mention 
  two additional modules cause they are the most used. (i.e file dialog and message box)
  
2. PIL(ImageTK, ImageOps, ImageDraw): We need these three modules from PIL to get the image processing libraries.
 
3. Collections: We need the collections module to create containers to store the data.
 
other important libraries used here are imghdr, os, image, and ctypes
 
some pictures of the GUI are added below
